<h2>About OpenPave.org</h2>

<p>OpenPave.org was started in 2006, by Jeremy Lea, a graduate student
from the University of California, Davis.  Jeremy was invloved in a
number of open source projects, including <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">
FreeBSD</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla and
Firefox</a>, and saw the power of open source to create really good
quality code first hand.  OpenPave.org was conceived as a vehicle to
distribute the pavement engineering code which he had written, in the
hopes that the community would participate.  In addition, there are no
programs for Linux/FreeBSD/MacOS X for pavement engineering, and it is
hoped that through OpenPave.org these applications can be developed,
allowing people to use these platforms rather than being forced to use
Windows.</p>

<p>It is encouraging that there are a number of people talking about
trying to open source their pavement engineering code, including some
moves to open source the MEPDG software.</p>

<p>OpenPave.org is currently hosted at UC Davis, on an old, spare
computer, running FreeBSD.  OpenPave.org accounts are available to
anyone who shows interest in contributing to the project.  An account
gives you shell access to the server and CVS access, along with an email
address and a place to host web pages.</p>
