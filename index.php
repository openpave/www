<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to OpenPave.org, the home of open source pavement engineering
software!  Open source software allows you, the user, to access the source
code for your software so that you can both see how it works and change it
to better perform the tasks for which you are using it.  This is
particularly valuable in engineering where you often need specialized
software for particular tasks.  Ordinarily this would mean having to code
your application from scratch, hence the proliferation of small programs
which are essentially the same.  With open source you can benefit from
building on a tested base, and all for free!</p>

<p>For you, the developer, open source gives you the ability to implement
your ideas without building from scratch, and to benefit from the changes of
other developers.  This is particularly valuable for students wishing to
explore new algorithms, and for researchers looking to calibrate models
without the expense of developing from scratch.</p>

<p>At the moment there is not a lot of code available through OpenPave.org,
but it is hoped that this will change quickly!  OpenPave.org code is not
intended to compete with commercial offerings, and currently only includes
the calculation 'engines', and no user interface code.</p>

<p>OpenPave.org code is distributed under the Academic Development and
Distribution License, which is similar to the Mozilla Public License, with
an added clause requiring that code used for academic publications be
published.</p>
