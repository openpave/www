	<h2>Welcome to Openpave.org</h2>

	<p>
		Welcome to OpenPave.org, the home of open source pavement engineering software. Open source
		software allows you, the user, to access the source code for your software so that you can
		both see how it works and change it to better perform the tasks for which you are using it.
		This is particularly valuable in engineering where you often need specialized software for
		particular tasks. Ordinarily this would mean having to code your application from scratch,
		hence the proliferation of small programs which are essentially the same. With open source
		you can benefit from building on a tested base, and all for free!

			A 64-bit version is now available! This should work with Office from Office XP through
			Office 2013 on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. This also includes some fixes and speed
			improvements. The spreadsheet has also been updated with more error checking. <a

		For you, the developer, open source gives you the ability to implement your ideas without
		building from scratch, and to benefit from the changes of other developers. This is
		particularly valuable for students wishing to explore new algorithms, and for researchers
		looking to calibrate models without the expense of developing from scratch.
	</p>

	<p>
		At the moment there is not a lot of code available through OpenPave.org, but it is hoped
		that this will change quickly! OpenPave.org code is not intended to compete with commercial
		offerings, and currently only includes the calculation 'engines', and no user interface
		code.
	</p>

	<p>
		OpenPave.org code is distributed under the Academic Development and Distribution License,
		which is similar to the Mozilla Public License (which is used by the Firefox web browser),
		with an added clause requiring that code used for academic publications be distributed.

	<h2>About OpenPave.org</h2>

	<p>
		OpenPave.org was started in 2006, by Jeremy Lea, a graduate student from the University of
		California, Davis. Jeremy has been involved in a number of open source projects, including <a
			href="http://www.freebsd.org/">
			FreeBSD</a>
		and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla and Firefox</a>, and saw the power of open
		source to create really good quality code first hand. OpenPave.org was conceived as a
		vehicle to distribute the pavement engineering code which he had written, in the hopes that
		the community would participate. In addition, there are no programs for Linux/FreeBSD/MacOS
		X for pavement engineering, and it is hoped that through OpenPave.org these applications can
		be developed, allowing people to use these platforms rather than being forced to use
		Windows.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is encouraging that there are a number of people talking about trying to open source
		their pavement engineering code, including some moves to open source the MEPDG software.
	</p>

	<p>OpenPave.org is currently hosted at UC Davis.</p>
